# Advent of Code 2020
This repo stores my participation to [Advent Of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about), an online event, involving small programming puzzles, one for each day during December (well... It's an Advent Calendar !)

If the GitHub embedded nbviewer doesn't work, use [this one](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Rowin/AoC/tree/main/)
